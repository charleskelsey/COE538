# COE538 Labs

**Lab 1:** Using the CodeWarrior IDE and Introduction to Assembly Programming
  *  Use the Serial Monitor program and CodeWarrior software for basic operations, such as examining and modifying memory locations and registers in the microprocessor system.
  * Using the ‘hand assembly method’, create and run a tiny program on the microprocessor system at full speed (with or without breakpoints).
  * Using a CodeWarrior’s text editor, create a complete assembly language program, assemble it, load it into
the microprocessor system, and run it.
  * Use breakpoint and memory dump techniques to debug problems with a source code program.
